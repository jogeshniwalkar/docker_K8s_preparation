What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform used to:

Develop
Ship
Run

applications inside containers — lightweight, portable, self-sufficient packages that include everything needed to run the software (code, runtime, libraries, configs).


🧱 What is a Docker Container?
Think of a container like a mini virtual computer, but:

It shares the host system's OS (much lighter than a full virtual machine).

It runs only the app you want with its exact environment.

It starts up super fast and uses less memory.


📦 Example Analogy
Imagine you’re shipping a software project:

Without Docker: You send loose parts and instructions (dependencies, config, code).

With Docker: You send a sealed, ready-to-run box with everything inside — plug-and-play!


🛠️ Docker Key Components
Component	What It Does
Dockerfile	Script that defines how to build your container
Image	Blueprint built from a Dockerfile
Container	A running instance of an image
Docker Engine	The runtime that builds, runs, and manages containers


🧪 Simple Use Case
You want to run a Python Flask app:

Write a Dockerfile saying: "Use Python 3.10, install Flask, copy my app".

Build an image: docker build -t myapp .

Run it: docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp

Boom 💥 — your app runs in an isolated, reproducible environment.
