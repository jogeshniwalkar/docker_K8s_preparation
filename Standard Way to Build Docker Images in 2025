TL;DR — Standard Way to Build Docker Images in 2025?
✅ The most standard and widely-used way is still:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t myapp:latest .
...using a Dockerfile.

BUT...

🔥 Modern teams are increasingly adopting Dockerfile-less or secure, cloud-native image builders for better performance, security, and automation.

🛠️ Main Ways Developers Build Docker Images Today:
1. 🧾 Dockerfile + Docker CLI (Classic & Still Popular)
Still the default for many devs and CI pipelines.

Simple, familiar, and portable.

Used with:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
docker push myapp:1.0
2. 🐳 Dockerfile + BuildKit (Modern Docker Build Engine)
Enabled by default in recent Docker versions.

Faster, better caching, supports secrets.

bash
Copy
Edit
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t myapp .
3. 🔒 Kaniko (Inside Kubernetes)
Builds Docker images without Docker daemon.

Safe to run in CI/CD pipelines inside K8s (e.g., GitHub Actions, Tekton).

Still uses Dockerfile.

4. 🛠 Buildah / Podman (Red Hat Ecosystem)
Daemonless builds (no dockerd)

Scriptable and secure for CI systems

Can use Dockerfile or manual layer-by-layer script

5. 🧠 Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) – Heroku/Google/VMware style
No Dockerfile at all!

Auto-detects languages and builds optimized OCI images.

bash
Copy
Edit
pack build myapp --builder heroku/buildpacks:20
6. 🔄 Bazel, Nixpacks, Jib, Ko, etc. (Build-integrated tools)
Jib for Java apps: builds optimized images without Dockerfile

Ko for Go apps: builds Go code into containers directly

📊 What Do Most Developers Use?
Team Type	Common Build Tool	Notes
Solo devs	docker build with Dockerfile	Fast and easy
Small teams	docker build with BuildKit	Better performance
Enterprises	Kaniko, Buildah, or Buildpacks in CI/CD	Security & reproducibility
Cloud-native	Cloud Native Buildpacks, Ko, Jib	Language-aware, Dockerless
GitHub Actions	Docker, BuildKit, or Kaniko via action	Depends on runner setup

🧠 Best Practice Today (2025-style)
✅ Still OK to use Dockerfile — it’s not dead!

✅ Enable BuildKit for faster, cleaner builds.

✅ In CI/CD pipelines — use Kaniko, Buildah, or Buildpacks for security and performance.

✅ Try Dockerless approaches if you're language-specific (Go, Java, etc.).
