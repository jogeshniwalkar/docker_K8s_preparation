Kubernetes can still use Docker images, but not Docker as a runtime anymore.

🧠 Explanation:
🐳 Docker vs Docker Images vs Container Runtime
Docker Images: These are just packaged applications (layers). Kubernetes still pulls and runs these.

Docker (Engine): This was the container runtime Kubernetes used under the hood until version 1.20.

Container Runtime: Kubernetes now uses a container runtime that supports the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) — like containerd, CRI-O, etc.

🔄 What Changed?
Since Kubernetes v1.20+, Docker as a runtime was deprecated, and by v1.24, it was completely removed.

BUT:

You can still build images using Docker and push them to registries. Kubernetes will pull and run those using containerd or another compatible runtime.

✅ TL;DR
Yes, Kubernetes still uses Docker images.

Kubernetes no longer uses Docker Engine as its container runtime, it uses containerd (or CRI-O).

You don’t need to change how you build images (docker build, docker push), unless you're doing something advanced that needs Docker runtime features (like Docker-in-Docker).

Want to see how this works practically (e.g. checking what runtime your cluster uses or building and deploying an image)?




You said:
Docker (Engine) means docker client or docker server/daemon ?

Excellent follow-up! Let’s clarify this.

🧱 Docker Architecture Basics
When we say Docker (Engine), we're referring primarily to the Docker daemon (dockerd), which is the server-side component.

Here's how it breaks down:

Component	Role	Description
docker (CLI)	Client	You type commands here (docker build, docker run, etc.)
dockerd	Daemon (Docker Engine)	Server-side process that runs containers, handles image pulls, networking, etc.
containerd	Low-level runtime (used internally by Docker)	Actually executes containers via runC
runC	Container runtime	The OCI-compatible runtime to run containers

🔥 In Kubernetes context
When Kubernetes removed support for Docker runtime, it stopped talking to the dockerd daemon directly.

But:

✅ Kubernetes still supports Docker-built images
❌ Kubernetes doesn’t support the Docker daemon (dockerd) as a runtime anymore

Instead, it talks directly to containerd or CRI-O, which are lighter and built for Kubernetes.

🧠 TL;DR
Docker Engine = dockerd (daemon) = the server-side runtime part of Docker.

Kubernetes no longer talks to dockerd, but still works fine with Docker images.

You can still use the Docker CLI to build and push images.

Let me know if you want to check what runtime your K8s cluster is using, or if you want to dive into containerd vs Docker more.

why k8s not using dockerd reason?

Great question — and this is a key design decision in the Kubernetes world.

🚫 Why Kubernetes Dropped dockerd as a Runtime
Kubernetes dropped support for the Docker daemon (dockerd) as a runtime because it wasn't designed for Kubernetes and had some architectural inefficiencies. Here's the full breakdown:

🔍 Top Reasons:
1. Does Not Implement CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
Kubernetes introduced the CRI to allow plugging in container runtimes cleanly.

dockerd does not implement CRI.

So Kubernetes needed an extra shim called dockershim to act as a translator.

🧩 More components = more complexity, bugs, and maintenance overhead.

2. Heavy and Monolithic
dockerd is a full container platform with features Kubernetes doesn’t need:

CLI

Build tools

Docker Swarm

Volumes, plugins, etc.

Kubernetes only needs a lightweight runtime to:

Pull images

Run containers

Handle networking

containerd and CRI-O do just that, nothing more.

3. Maintenance Burden of dockershim
The Kubernetes team had to maintain dockershim to support Docker.

It became a burden, especially with changes to Docker internals.

They officially deprecated it in K8s v1.20, removed it in v1.24.

4. containerd is Already Under the Hood
Docker actually uses containerd under the hood.

So running Docker inside Kubernetes was like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Kubernetes → dockershim → dockerd → containerd → runC
When it could just be:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Kubernetes → containerd → runC
➤ Much simpler, leaner, and more efficient.

✅ What’s Still Supported?
Docker images? ✅ Yes, because they're OCI-compliant.

Docker CLI (build/push)? ✅ Yes, you can still build/push with Docker.

Docker daemon? ❌ Not supported as a runtime in Kubernetes anymore.

TL;DR Summary
Reason	Description
❌ No CRI	dockerd doesn’t support Kubernetes' Container Runtime Interface
🚫 Extra Shim	dockershim added unnecessary complexity
🐘 Too Heavy	Docker has features Kubernetes doesn’t need
⚡ Simplified Stack	Switching to containerd is faster and cleaner
🛠️ Maintenance Pain	Kubernetes team no longer wanted to maintain compatibility
